```

## Categories and Projects

- `category or technology` - Represents a group of projects related by a specific technology stack or concept, such as 'frontend', 'ai', or 'blockchain'.

  - `project-name` - Each project within a category has its own directory, which includes a `src` folder with the source code, a `README.md` for documentation, and other necessary files.

- `another-category` - Another grouping of projects, which could be organized by different criteria like complexity, development stage, or team.

- `project-name` - Standalone projects that are not part of a specific category are placed directly under the root directory.

To work with a project:

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project's directory, which may be within a specific category or at the root level:
3. Refer to the `README.md` within the project directory for instructions specific to that project.

Please note that the actual structure may vary, and you should consult the individual `README.md` files for project-specific organization and details.
